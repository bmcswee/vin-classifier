# SKLearn VIN Classifier

Several different types of classifiers are used to predict the make, model, and year of a vehicle from its vehicle identification number (VIN).

## Getting Started

The project consists of four parts: a data scraper targeting Cars.com, a utility script for cleaning scraped data, the classifiers themselves, and a standalone script allowing the user to enter a VIN and receive a prediction.

### Dataset

A small dataset of approximately 3300 training examples is included, and can be found in the data-cleaner directory. The user may scrape additional examples from Cars.com using the included script.
